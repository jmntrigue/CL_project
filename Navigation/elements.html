            <h3>Alliance Requirements</h3>
            <p> Our alliance has a few requirements.  To be able to remain a member, all you have to       do is abide in them.
            </p>
        </div>
        </div>
        <div class="requirements">
            <h3 class="rule">Fully Participate in <br>Alliance Events &amp; Quests</h3>
            <p>
                We're a team.  If we all work together, we can win some really sweet rewards from the alliance events and quests.  However,
                this often means that you will have to put the alliance's needs ahead of your own.  You won't be able to do
                things at the exact moment you want to do them, but if you can exercise a little patience, we will all reap
                the benefits.  By working together and setting aside our personal goals, we will all become stronger players.   
            </p>
            <p>
                Alliance quests are currently our main area of focus.  We want to rank as high as possible to get more shards and
                even try to win a basic 4<i class="fa fa-star"></i> champion for everyone in the group.  Therefore, we expect
                everyone to participate as much as possible during the Alliance Quests.  If you will not be available, please
                let an officer know so we can make accommodations.  For tips on maximizing your contribution to the quests,
                please read the guide.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our alliance has advanced to the point where the alliance events are almost automatic for us.  We can win most
                of the events without putting much focus on them.  However, as a member of the alliance, there are two events
                that we expect everyone to give their full attention:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Duel Skirmish</b> &ndash; This one-day event rolls around once each week.  During this event everyone must defeat the specified Summoner ten times.</li>
                <li><b>Completion</b> &ndash; During this three-day event, you must score as many points as possible by completing story quests.  This is an event where we can win alpha catalysts plus some nice rank rewards if everyone pitches in.</li>
            </ul>
