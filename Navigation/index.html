			To join our alliance, you must meet three requirements:
	1.	You must have a player rating of at least 40,000
	2.	You must be willing and able to join LINE for alliance chat
	3.	You must be willing to abide by the TWO RULES that we set for our alliance members (see below)
If you can handle that, then please contact one of the officers, which are listed above.

TWO RULES!
Our alliance has two rules. If you want to remain a member, all you have to do is follow these two, simple rules.
1. Join LINE
Global chat is worthlessâ€¦Instead, we use an external app called LINE for all alliance discussions. You can install LINE as an app on your phone, tablet or you can use it through your computer's web browser. Please instal it, it is essential to our game disscussions and AQ (Alliance Quest).

		<div class="b_events clearfix">
			2. Fully Participate in Alliance Events & Quests
If we all work together, we can win some really sweet rewards from the alliance events and quests. However, this often means that you will have to put the alliance's needs ahead of your own. You won't be able to do things at the exact moment you want to do them, but if you can exercise a little patience, we will all reap the benefits. By working together and setting aside our personal goals, we will all become stronger players.
