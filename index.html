                            <h3>Alliance Quest</h3>
                            <p>Alliance quests are currently our main area of focus. We want to rank as high as possible to get more shards and even try to win a 5 shards and items to rank your 4 champion for everyone in the group. They provide the opportunity for lucrative rewards for everyone, and for many of us they are a fun alternative to the daily grind that the game often demands. That said, top performance in an alliance quest requires teamwork. Communication and strategy are essential to success in the alliance quests.</p>
                            <h3>Alliance Events</h3>
                            <p>Alliance Events are event that occurs on a cyclical basis: one, three, six, seven, and 30 day special events. These events help you to level and rank your champions, even add champions to your roster.</p> 
                            <p>Our alliance has advanced to the point where the alliance events are almost automatic for us. We can win most of the events without putting much focus on them.</p>

                            <p>However, as a member of the alliance, there are three events that we expect everyone to give their full attention. Lack of participation in these events could get you kicked from the Squad.<br>They are listed below:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Summoner Advancement - this is where you take all the rewards ISO, and crystal and use them for points ranking and rare items. </li>
                            <li>Duel Skirmish – This one-day event rolls around once each week. During this event everyone must defeat the specified Summoner ten times.</li>
                            <li>Completion – During this three-day event, you must score as many points as possible by completing story quests. This is an event where we can win alpha catalysts plus some nice rank rewards if everyone pitches in.</li>
                        </ul>

                            <div class="col-md-12 col-xs-12"> <h1>Strategies for Playing Contest of Champions </h1>
                                <h2>Overall Development Plan </h2>
                                     <p>A common question for players at all levels (but particularly new players) is: What should be my overall plan for building up my team. There are, of course, many different paths you can follow. Below are some general guidelines to help you think about your long-term goals.</p>
    </div>
                                 <div class="belv col-md-4 col-xs-12">
                                    <h2>Beginner Level</h2> 
                                    <p>When you first start playing, you should start by trying to build up a team of 2 champions. You can get 2s from the Daily Crystal and from Crystal Corncob each Sunday. If you have less than five 2 champs, you might even choose to spend your units on a Premium Hero Crystal. As you get 2 champs, do as many quests as you can. This will give you ISO-8, which you can use to level up your champs. Once you get 12â€”15 champs up to Rank 2, you will be ready to seriously compete in the 2 arena. This will allow you to win 3 champions so you can start building the next level of your team.</p>
    </div>
                                 <div class="imlv col-lg-4 col-md-12 col-xs-12"><h2>Intermediate Level</h2>
                                     <p>Once you've got a strong stable of 2 champions, you will want to leverage it to build up your 3 champions. Your long-term goal here will be to get 3 maxed out 3 champions so you can fully contribute to the alliance quests. One common mistake Summoners make is to buy a bunch of Premium Crystals with the hope that it will drop a 3 character. This is not an efficient way to get 3 characters. Instead, follow this advice from Kilo18: NEVER buy premium crystals. Instead, save up 400 units and wait for the 3 Crystal offer. This offer comes up after opening 10 Premium Crystals. You can earn Premium Crystals from competing in the 3v3 arenas and from alliance rewards. When the three-day Crystal Rush event happens, hopefully you've saved up 10 Premium Crystals and 400 units. This is the most efficient manner of playing this game.</p>
    </div>
                                 <div class="adlv col-sm-4 col-xs-12">
                                     <h2>Advanced Level</h2>
                                     <p>Once you've mastered the concepts presented, you can move on to some of the more advanced techniques. Following these tips will win you the loyalty and admiration of your alliance teammates.<br>
                                     If you already have at least five 2 champions on your team, do not waste your units on Premium Crystals. The chances of getting a 3 or 4 champion from those crystals is really low. Besides, you'll get plenty of Premium Crystals from the alliance events and your arena wins. So don't waste your units on them. Instead save your units for when the game randomly offers you a chance to buy a 3 Crystal. That's a much better use of your money. Compete in the medium and hard item quests during the Collector's Free-for-All on Sunday of each week, finishing as much as you can without burning a lot of revives or health. A leisurely stroll through it might give you an alpha catalyst. You will need these when you're ready to start ranking up your 4 champions.<br>With the Addition of 4 and 5 star Shards, you can build up enough shards to get get 4 star shard crystals. By participating in events, you gain more shards to get one “free.” Also by completing Act 3, you will receive a 4 Star Crystal, as well.
                                     When you get your first 4 champion, immediately start gathering rank up materials, even if that means just trying the easy side of the Collector's Free-for-All once each week. The catalysts for ranking up these champions are rare so take every opportunity to grab them! Next but most important, your masteries. There are many guides online that gives good advice about how to set up your Masteries.</p>
                                </div>         
                                 <div class="selv">
                                    <h2>Sensei-Level Wisdom</h2>
                                     <p>Now I shall reveal the greatest secret of this game. Ponder this: "Contest of Champions" is not a fighting game. Yes, it's true that you spend a lot of time tapping and swiping to defeat enemies. And, yes, it's probably the thrill of fighting with your favorite Marvel heroes that lured you into the game. And, of course, the fighting part of the game is a lot of fun. However, the fighting part is not the true heart of the game.</p>
                                    <p>Instead, like most "freemium" games, this game is about collecting. You are trying to collect rewards so you can progress. The whole point of the game is to get as much ISO-8, gold, and hero crystals as you possibly can. To maximize your rewards, you do not need to focus on getting better at swiping and tapping.</p>       <p>Instead, you always ask yourself one question: What can I do to maximize my rewards?</p>
                                    <p>This is why the techniques described above are so important. By maximizing the points you contribute to the alliance, you maximize the rewards you receive. You also make all of the other alliance members stronger, which maximizes their ability to earn more rewards for you. Now go forth, grasshopper. Do not worry about swiping and tapping. Think only of ways to maximize the rewards you earn</p>
